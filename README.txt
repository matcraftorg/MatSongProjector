Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Download is available from http://matcraft.org/, the official website.

You need Qt (https://www.qt.io/) at least version 5.0 to be able to compile
MatSongProjector. Most Linux distributions normally already package the latest
version of Qt, so it is likely that you need to worry about this. However,
you need the development package as well (sometimes named as qt-devel or
qt5-devel, it varies depends on the distributions).

The simplest way to compile MatSongProjector package is:

1. Extract the source archive.
2.`cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and type
     `qmake' to generate the Makefile for your system.
3. Type `make' on Linux or `mingw32-make` on Windows to compile the package.
4. The executable file MatSongProjector (MatSongProjector.exe under Windows) is built on /bin directory.

You can also compile MatSongProjector under Windows throughs `windows-build.bat' script file.
